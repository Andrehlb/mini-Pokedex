# Mini-Pokedex (Native Android with Kotlin)

A simple Pokedex app for Android, developed in Kotlin as the final project for the Venturus Native Android course. It features list/detail screens, search/filter functionality, and consumes the public Pok√©API.

This project is being developed following Android best practices, with sprints, Git versioning, and incremental documentation of theoretical and practical concepts learned throughout the course.

## Development Log - Sprint 1: Foundation, Lifecycle, and Initial Navigation

The goal of this Sprint is to establish the project's architectural foundation, master the lifecycle of Activities and Fragments, implement navigation between screens (Single-Activity/Fragment Architecture with Navigation Component), and ensure state persistence during configuration changes.

---

### ‚úÖ Task 0: Environment and Project Setup
* **Status:** Completed
* **Subtasks:**
  1. Create a GitHub repository with `README.md`, `.gitignore` (Android), and `LICENSE` (MIT).
  2. Initialize the Android Studio project (`Empty Views Activity`).
  3. Enable View Binding in `build.gradle.kts`.
  4. Initial commit with the basic structure.
* **Reference:**  
  **Class 4 (09/25/2025) ‚Äî Building the 1st App / View Binding**
* **Expected Result:**  
  Project compiles, runs, and the initial structure is versioned.

---

### ‚úÖ Task 1: Understanding and Visualizing the Activity Lifecycle
* **Status:** Completed
* **Description:** Implementation of logs (`Log.d`) in all lifecycle methods (`onCreate`, `onStart`, `onResume`, `onPause`, `onStop`, `onDestroy`, `onRestart`) in `MainActivity`. Running the app, analyzing logs in Logcat, and using Debug mode for practical understanding of the lifecycle.
* **Applied Concepts:**
  * Android Activity lifecycle methods and their calls, as covered in **Class 6 (10/02/2025) ‚Äì Lifecycle and Debugging**.

---

### ‚è≥ Task 2: Implementation of `SplashActivity` and Navigation
* **Status:** In progress
* **Description:** Creation of the splash screen, with a timer for automatic transition to the main screen and correct Back Stack management.
* **Applied Concepts:**
  * Creating `Activity`: **Class 4 (09/25/2025) - Building the 1st App**.
  * Explicit `Intent`: To start `MainActivity` from `SplashActivity`. Covered in **Class 5 (09/30/2025) - App Navigation**.
  * Back Stack management with `finish()`: To prevent the user from returning to the Splash Screen. Covered in **Class 5 (09/30/2025) - App Navigation**.

---

### ‚è≥ Task 3: Saving and Restoring State (onSaveInstanceState/Bundle)
* **Status:** In progress
* **Description:** Implement state persistence during configuration changes (e.g., screen rotation), using `onSaveInstanceState` and `Bundle` to save/restore important variable states.
* **Applied Concepts:**
  * State persistence in Activities.
  * Use of Bundle and lifecycle methods to save/restore data.
  * **Class 6 (10/02/2025) ‚Äì Lifecycle, State, and Debugging**

---

### üî≤ Task 4: Single-Activity Architecture, Fragments, and Navigation Component
* **Status:** Pending
* **Description:** Migrate navigation to a Fragment-based architecture, create and configure the Navigation Component, implement safe navigation between screens, and advanced Back Stack control.
* **Planned Concepts:**
  * Fragment lifecycle (`onCreate`, `onCreateView`, `onViewCreated`, `onDestroyView`)
  * Use of the Navigation Component (`nav_graph.xml`, actions, Safe Args, popUpTo)
  * **Class 6 (10/02/2025) ‚Äì Fragments and Advanced Navigation**

---

### üî≤ Task 5: Data Structure, Layouts, and Adapter
* **Status:** Pending
* **Planned Concepts:**
  * `data class`: To model Pok√©mon data. Covered in **Class 3 (09/18/2025) - OOP**.
  * `ConstraintLayout`: To build the layout for each list item. Covered in **Class 4 (09/25/2025) - Layouts**.
  * `RecyclerView` and `Adapter`: For efficient list display.
  * Higher-Order Functions (Lambda): To handle click events on each item.
  * **Class 2 (09/11/2025) - Functions**

---

## üõ† Technologies and Libraries

* **Language:** Kotlin
* **Architecture:** MVVM (to be implemented)
* **Android Jetpack Libraries:**
  * View Binding
  * Navigation Component (to be implemented)
  * ViewModel (to be implemented)
  * RecyclerView
* **Networking:** Retrofit & Coroutines (to be implemented)
* **Images:** Coil/Glide (to be implemented)

## Notes

- [REVIEW] Points marked as ‚ÄúXXX‚Äù or doubts in class notes should be clarified before moving on to the next Sprint.
- TODO: Start API integration and instrumented tests in a future Sprint.
- Always ensure the app compiles, runs, and logs correctly before each commit.

- Always cite:  
  **Class X (MM/DD/YYYY) ‚Äì Topic**
- Mark doubts with `[REVIEW]` and reference the original PDF/note.
- Example:
